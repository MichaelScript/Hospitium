## Overview

[Hospitium](http://hospitium.co/) is the brain child of Apple Wood Rescue, a small animal rescue in Denver Colorado. Developed to fit the needs of the rescue, it has since been open sourced for anyone to use.

The software is completely **_free_**. You can modify it all you want and you can share it with anyone.

You can support the project by:

- Donating to [Apple Wood Rescue](http://www.applewoodrescue.org/donate/)
- Contributing to the development of Hospitium on [GitHub](https://github.com/ninetwentyfour/Hospitium)

## Running Hospitium with Docker
> Currently the build process isn't completely automated, however it's shorter than manually installing.
1. Run `docker-compose up`
2. In a different terminal run `docker exec -u root -it hospitium bash -l`
3. Within this new shell run the following:
```
mkdir /usr/src/app/tmp
chmod 777 /usr/src/app/tmp
service postgresql start
# Switch to the postgres user
su - postgres
cd /usr/src/app
# Need to change postgres to use utf-8 rather than ascii by default
./update-utf8.sh
# If it hasn't been created previously
rake db:create; rake db:migrate; rake db:seed;
bundle exec rails server Puma -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000;
```
In a browser go to localhost:3000
